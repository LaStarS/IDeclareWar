# I Declare War

This is my version of I declare war. The purpose of the game is to claim all cards in the deck.

I used HTML, CSS and JS to create this game.

##Live link

Here is the link to the game: https://github.com/LaStarS/GameOnWar.git

##How the game is played.

This is a player versus computer game. The player and computer will each throw out a card, the highest card wins. Whoever wins takes both cards into their pile. This continues until one player has all the cards.
